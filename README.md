Yes, you can absolutely run a Dataplex DataScan independently on a BigQuery table! Dataplex DataScans are designed to work directly with BigQuery tables (among other data sources) to perform data quality checks or profiling without requiring additional dependencies like Tasks or preprocessing pipelines. Your YAML configuration already demonstrates this capability by targeting BigQuery tables (`customers` and `orders`) with specific DQ rules.

Here’s how it works and what you need to know:

---

### **Running a DataScan Independently on a BigQuery Table**
A DataScan operates independently as long as:
1. The BigQuery table exists and is accessible.
2. You provide a valid configuration (e.g., your YAML) specifying the table’s URI and rules.
3. You have the necessary permissions in your Google Cloud project.

Your YAML already defines two independent DataScan checks:
- `customers_check`: Validates `customer_id` for non-null values.
- `orders_check`: Ensures `order_amount` falls within 0–1000.

When you execute the DataScan using the `gcloud` command, Dataplex will directly query the BigQuery tables specified in the `entity_uri` fields and apply the rules—no preprocessing or Tasks required.

---

### **Steps to Run the DataScan**
Assuming your YAML is saved as `dq_config.yaml`, here’s how to run it independently:

1. **Verify Prerequisites**:
   - The tables (`customers` and `orders`) exist in `projects/your-project-id/datasets/your-dataset`.
   - You have permissions (e.g., `dataplex.datascans.create`, `bigquery.tables.getData`).

2. **Run the DataScan**:
   Use the `gcloud` command I provided earlier:
   ```bash
   gcloud dataplex datascans create data-quality dq-job \
     --location=your-region \
     --data-quality-spec-file=dq_config.yaml \
     --project=your-project-id
   ```
   - This creates and runs a one-time DataScan job directly on your BigQuery tables.
   - Replace `your-region` and `your-project-id` with actual values.

3. **Check Results**:
   - Once completed, view the DQ results in the Google Cloud Console under Dataplex > DataScans, or use:
     ```bash
     gcloud dataplex datascans describe dq-job --location=your-region --project=your-project-id
     ```

---

### **Does It Truly Run Independently?**
Yes! Here’s why:
- **Direct BigQuery Access**: The `entity_uri` (e.g., `bigquery://projects/your-project-id/datasets/your-dataset/tables/customers`) tells Dataplex exactly where to look. It queries the table directly via BigQuery.
- **No Preprocessing Required**: Your rules (`NOT_NULL` and `RANGE`) are applied as-is to the existing data in the specified columns (`customer_id` and `order_amount`).
- **Self-Contained**: The DataScan doesn’t rely on external workflows or Tasks unless you explicitly trigger them based on the results.

---

### **Optional Enhancements**
While it runs independently, you can customize it further:
- **Scheduling**: Add `--execution-schedule` to run it periodically (e.g., daily):
  ```bash
  gcloud dataplex datascans create data-quality dq-job \
    --location=your-region \
    --data-quality-spec-file=dq_config.yaml \
    --project=your-project-id \
    --execution-schedule="0 0 * * *"  # Daily at midnight UTC
  ```
- **Row Filters**: Your YAML uses `row_filter: NONE`, but you could filter rows (e.g., `row_filter: "order_date > '2023-01-01'"`) to scope the check to specific data.

---

### **What Happens During Execution?**
1. Dataplex reads your YAML and identifies the BigQuery tables and columns.
2. It applies the rules:
   - `NOT_NULL` on `customer_id` in the `customers` table.
   - `RANGE` (0–1000) on `order_amount` in the `orders` table.
3. It generates a report with pass/fail results for each rule, stored in Dataplex and optionally exportable to BigQuery.

---

### **Limitations to Note**
- **Read-Only**: DataScans only validate or profile data; they don’t modify the BigQuery table.
- **Permissions**: Ensure your service account or user has access to both Dataplex and the BigQuery dataset.
- **Scale**: For very large tables, execution time depends on BigQuery’s query performance.

---

### **Your YAML in Action**
Your configuration is already set up to run independently on BigQuery:
- `customers_check` targets `customer_id` in the `customers` table.
- `orders_check` targets `order_amount` in the `orders` table.

You don’t need to do anything else—just execute the `gcloud` command, and it’ll work directly against those tables.

---

### **Confirmation**
To confirm it’s independent:
- No Tasks or external jobs are referenced in your YAML or required for this to run.
- The `gcloud dataplex datascans create` command is all you need.

==========================

Below is a complete and valid `dq_config.yaml` file based on the snippet you provided earlier, expanded to meet Dataplex Data Quality requirements. This YAML defines rules and rule bindings to perform data quality checks on BigQuery tables independently, as we’ve discussed.

---

### **dq_config.yaml**
```yaml
# Data Quality Specification for Dataplex DataScan
dataQualitySpec:
  # Sampling configuration (optional, defaults to full table scan if omitted)
  samplingPercent: 100.0  # Scan the entire table; adjust as needed (e.g., 10.0 for 10%)

  # Define DQ rules
  rules:
    - name: not_null_rule
      ruleType: NOT_NULL
      dimension: COMPLETENESS
      description: "Ensures the column has no null values"
      # No params needed for NOT_NULL

    - name: range_rule
      ruleType: RANGE
      dimension: VALIDITY
      description: "Ensures values are within the specified range"
      params:
        minValue: 0
        maxValue: 1000
      ignoreNull: true  # Ignores null values in range check

  # Define rule bindings to specific BigQuery tables and columns
  ruleBindings:
    - name: customers_check
      entityUri: "bigquery://projects/your-project-id/datasets/your-dataset/tables/customers"
      columnId: "customer_id"
      rowFilter: "NONE"  # No filtering; scan all rows
      rules:
        - ruleName: not_null_rule
      description: "Check that customer_id is not null"

    - name: orders_check
      entityUri: "bigquery://projects/your-project-id/datasets/your-dataset/tables/orders"
      columnId: "order_amount"
      rowFilter: "NONE"  # No filtering; scan all rows
      rules:
        - ruleName: range_rule
      description: "Check that order_amount is between 0 and 1000"

# Optional: Output configuration (e.g., export results to BigQuery)
dataQualityResult:
  outputTable: "projects/your-project-id/datasets/your-dataset/tables/dq_results"
```

---

### **Key Sections Explained**
1. **`dataQualitySpec`**:
   - Root section for the DQ configuration.
   - `samplingPercent`: Controls how much of the table is scanned (100% means full table). You can reduce this for faster testing on large tables.

2. **`rules`**:
   - `not_null_rule`: Checks for non-null values in `customer_id`.
   - `range_rule`: Ensures `order_amount` is between 0 and 1000.
   - `dimension`: Maps to DQ dimensions (e.g., `COMPLETENESS`, `VALIDITY`) for reporting.
   - `ignoreNull`: For `range_rule`, skips null values to avoid false failures.

3. **`ruleBindings`**:
   - `customers_check`: Applies `not_null_rule` to the `customer_id` column in the `customers` table.
   - `orders_check`: Applies `range_rule` to the `order_amount` column in the `orders` table.
   - `entityUri`: Specifies the BigQuery table path.
   - `rowFilter`: Set to `NONE` to scan all rows; you can add SQL-like filters (e.g., `"order_date > '2023-01-01'"`) if needed.

4. **`dataQualityResult`** (Optional):
   - Exports DQ results to a BigQuery table (`dq_results`). Omit this if you just want results in Dataplex.

---

### **Adjustments from Your Original YAML**
Your original snippet was close but needed slight restructuring:
- Added `dataQualitySpec` as the top-level key (required by Dataplex).
- Renamed `rule_type` to `ruleType` and adjusted case for consistency (`NOT_NULL`, `RANGE`).
- Added `name` fields to rules and bindings for clarity and reference.
- Made keys camelCase or PascalCase to match Dataplex YAML conventions.

---

### **How to Use It**
1. **Save the YAML**:
   Copy the above into a file named `dq_config.yaml`.

2. **Replace Placeholders**:
   - `your-project-id`: Your Google Cloud project ID.
   - `your-dataset`: Your BigQuery dataset name.
   - Ensure the `customers` and `orders` tables exist in that dataset.

3. **Run the DataScan**:
   Execute the following `gcloud` command:
   ```bash
   gcloud dataplex datascans create data-quality dq-job \
     --location=your-region \
     --data-quality-spec-file=dq_config.yaml \
     --project=your-project-id
   ```

---

### **Verification**
- After running, Dataplex will validate:
  - `customer_id` in `customers` has no nulls.
  - `order_amount` in `orders` is between 0 and 1000.
- Results appear in Dataplex or the specified `dq_results` table if you include the output configuration.

Let me know if you want to tweak this further (e.g., add more rules, filters, or output options)!
